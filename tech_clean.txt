Hope For A Higher Power
(Chorus)\nIf there is a final hour\nLet's hope for a higher power\n1 by 1 and 2 by 2\nI have ammo what about you (x2)\n\n(Verse 1)\nGrandma told me the good book said\nIn the last days get ready for the ten plagues\n1st the rivers will be ran with red\n2, 3, and 4 dead frogs will cause lice and flies\nSick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives\n6, 7, and 8 a boil storms a fire and locusts\n9 is darkness so dark it's hard for you to focus\nAnd 10 is death of the firstborn\nIf I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point\nTo get at me and battle me maybe have this verse torn\nHow will this curse form?\nWell Creationism and Darwinism been at it forever bout at it I got nothin but hurt for em\nCuz really nobody knows when you live then you die where your body goes\nIf it's Hell or it's Heaven\n6 or the 7 well I'll keep the nina for our be foes in a gamble\nThat's what life is and it's hard to handle\nWhen the bible says worship this by the scriptures written by man though\nSo when man destroys us the word might not stand so\nTill that day I'm just gon protect my fam with ammo\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(VERSE 2)\nI've been looking for something supernatural for a long time now\nBut I never got proof that a spiritural realm existed wanted to find how\nEverybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?\nWondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king\nI know it sounds far fetched, every night I put knees on the carpet\nThen I pray to who's up with the star set\nCuz the earth in its self is a target\nFor destruction, for combustion\nCuz there ain't too many you can trust in\nThink of all the women losing their husbands\nIn Iraq a lot of killing and suffering\nWhat I hope for, seems folklore\nWhen the enemy kills and gloat more\nCuz they killin us off in this hoax war\nThen I wake up yellin and my throats sore\nCuz the fight's there, its a nightmare\nIf it come to me I'm in my snipe wear\nIf a bullet give my lung a slight tear\nI wanna believe that the light's there\nSo all you Christians don't get mad at me\nI just hope that your mystical, magical miracle's workin catastrophies\nAnd this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy\nI hope for a higher power when I look at all these tragedies\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Hook)\nI will never follow the beliefs of man, why? Because man destroys everything in his path\n\n(Verse 3)\nOh what a miracle, angels and demons\nBut the only miracle is that people keep believin\nRight hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle\nKeep that for my rivals and evil desciples\nExpand your mission, man to women\nWhen they attack do you plan to give in\nOr do you do like I do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition\nPeople like us\nPiece and knife up\nCuz we got evil to sweep and wipe up\nDevils and demons and humans, irrelevant, so if they lookin deceiving I bust\nI hope that the higher power is watching over me\nCuz we young people don't see faith like most the older see\nIf he or she is listenin\nA mere sign can spark me\nBut if the laws in the bible are bogus\nThen prepare for anarchy\nWorst case scenario is there never ever was a higher power\nSo in the midst of chaos now\nThe only real savior is fire power\n\n(Chorus)

Crybaby
[Verse 1]\nI was born in 71' in Kansas City, MO\nMy momma was a heavenly one, so the fam was pretty slow\nWhen it came to rap and R&amp;B and plenty more\nCheck it, if it wasn't no gospel, apostle\nOr written in the Bible, then it go\nSo when they tell the baby don't do something then end up doing it anyway\nLike, don't listen to rap, it's the evil music of today\nBut, I really fell in love with the sound that was coming out form the East Coast\nSo we got it and twisted it up a bit, now the industry's having a heatstroke\nSome say that rap is dead, but when I get the white, black, and red\nAnd jump on the tour bus, do 58 shows, then I'm back with a big black sack of bread\nCan't believe that that was said, cause I'm here with a stack of fed\nAnd I got it from rap/hip-hop or whatever and I did not have to beg\nSo, here I stand, the mic in hand with my rap attire\nAnd I like my fans spending grands cause we got the fire\nI merchandise like 5 G's every half an hour\nAnd you cry like a baby so your mic must be your pacifier\n\n[Hook]\nWhen I read the magazine, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH WAH WAH (Crybaby)\nWhen I see them on the TV, them rapper's sounding like\nWAH WAH WAH (Whatcha crying bout?)\n[X2]\n\n[Verse 2]\nIf it's negative, I don't wanna hear it\nEliminating player haters with their evil spirits\n\nI hear em talkin, they mad at Smurf and Soulja Boy\nThey hating big in the magazine, and dont even know the boys\nI know the ploy, washed up rappers wanna attack people\nRun up to the car, pull out the mac lethal\nMan that's a problem with the black people now\nWhat ya need to know is that, in the world there's a lot of dough to stack\nAnd the ones that wanna hold us back ain't been outside they cul-de-sac\nEvery nigga I know is strapped, rip shows that'll blow ya back\nBut notice that, I can put it right down to where the shoulders at\nHating on the south? Why? Trippin off them chips they got\nYou don't like that it's screwed and chopped\nBut you wanna get off in they pot\nWanna be MC you talk a lot, up in the spot and you hot\nCause they 84's be poking out\nWhat the hell is you cryin bout?\nEverybody wanna be killa but not for reala\nBout the method of making money you gotta get the milla\nBy doin it like I do it do the work and believe in it\nWhen you do it to the fullest ain't no problem achieving it\nWhen I was broke, homie I went for mills\nGot on the mic with the intent to kill\nStronger than ever, and you a gimp for real\nI drink Caribou Lou, and you drink Enfamil CHUMP\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou should be clapping when folk make it up outta the ghetto\nOr trailer park, it don't matter even if he black or if he guerro\nBut, you don't know how to be male\nInstead of a Timberland, you probably in a Stiletto\nBetter yet in a baby shoe, jealous or maybe you\nSick of me cause I'm making dinero\nAnd you dont wanna get clapped at\nYou want a standing ovation? I thought not!\nYou say you better than rappers on radio, man that's false chop\nTry to run up on me, cause a Benzo will never be in your car slot\nTry to step up on the scene, my infra-red beam's right at your soft spot\nIf you was on TV and balling you wouldn't groan and trip\nHe'd keep hatred, envy, and bloodshed on his lip\nTech got long cream with chrome things on his whip\nHe with a stone nein with a chrome thing on his hip\nBut just know your hip will not stop the hop\nCause when you look at the big picture, my block pops a lot daily\nSo keep on thinking my clock stops the shots\nAnd I can quickly bury you in your Osh Kosh B'Gosh, baby\n\n[Hook]

Why You Ain't Call Me?
(Tech N9ne)\nTo whom it may concern...\n\n(Chorus)\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nI'm not broken-hearted, but I couldv'e been old when I started\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou know I'm the hardest, you know that my art is applauded\nWhy you ain't call me?\nYou sleep on my music and that's a damn shame cause I slam my bang\n\n(Verse 1)\nI've been inside every hip-hop circle you could imagine\nGangster or Pop, even backpackers know that I'm real good at rappin'\nI was strugglin' back in the day when my hood was lackin'\nYo so I'm 'bout to talk about what shoulda, woulda and coulda happened\nIf music was about inovatin' and penetratin' generations by generatin' musical intergration\nIt wouldn't be about limitation and demonstration\nImitation within a blatant looks just disentigratin'\nIt ain't about the music, it's just about the fame\nIf you ain't popular homie, then you just out the game\nIf video and radio don't frequently announce your name\nThey don't know your music even though you blow most out the frame\nBut a closed mouth don't get fed when it stays shut\nLay cuts with Tecca Nina cause he can straight bust\nSay what? You ain't heard of me gettin' paid bucks?\nTouring, y'all see me rippin' the stage up\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse 2)\nI've been on tour with Hov, 'bout 27 shows\nWhy he ain't have me on a record only heaven knows\nMaybe he missed us, missin' the big picture\nThat this is a fixture, aw yeah, he got Twista!\nWell Twista's my homie and we both from the Midwest\nAnd I guess Hov ain't lookin' for another speedy rapper kid yet\nMe collaboratin' with them was all in me dreams\nMatter fact the only one of 'em called me was Beens\nHe told me he played you "The Industry Is Punks"\nAnd you loved it so you know Tech is what the industry would want\nI started down at the bottom, got with TOG and then it paid\nBut I wouldv'e loved to been on the third verse of "Renegade"\nThey must think I'm a stick of dynamite with no stem\nThat's probably why I got D12 but no Em!\nBut I burst flame and I bet that y'all know my first name\nCause I'm the hardest this side of Earth mane\n\n(Chorus)\n\n(Verse 3)\nThis ain't no hate-mail, this a love letter\nI love you niggas' music and I hope is does better\nI just wish you woulda hit a brother that love cheddar\nBut I'm ballin' now and I'm better than I was EVER\nSpace age flows like Jesse and Primrose\nTin-fold, I used to open-up, now I end shows\nGrim road, when you one of the best with slim dough\nAnd you ain't got Dre, Storch, Pharrell and no Timbo\nI've met almost half of the DTP\nBut the couple times I spoke to Luda, don't think he see me\nHad never met I-20 but he spoke at BET\nShawnna love me, Field Mob and Chingy decently speak me\nSo I'mma re-inaurate the game, it's all fame\nAnd you don't get no play if you an emcee with a small name\nIf I wanna get on TV I guess I gotta call Pain\nAnd Nelly, my great-grandmother's name is Maud Haynes\n\n(Hook)\nMaybe I'm trippin', full of delusion\nMaybe it come from all the drugs I was usin'\nMaybe I am the best thing that you ever saw\nMaybe I'm wrong and you don't know me at all\nI guess I'm blinded, I got reminded\nThat none of you just will ever know who the N9ne is\nAnd you never heard of the homie from the Show-me\nPUNK THAT! I know you niggas know me\n\n(Chorus x2)


Blackboy
[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]\nAnd I was told in school I was a fool and money, I'd never gain none\nBut I used my flow as a tool, they was cruel\nSaid I'd be no rapper, but I did work and became one\nNow it's a cryin' shame, I'm buyin' thangs and they got debts they got to pay back\nI think I know why my teachers would look in my eye and say that\nAnd why's that\n\n[Refrain - Big Krizz Kaliko]\nCause I'm a Blackboy\nCame from nothin', don't mean my life means nothin'\nMade it out the game through the pain and sufferin'\nY'all don't think I see them purses y'all clutchin', I do\nSee I'm a Blackboy\nScared when you see me, frauds disappear like a genie\nLittle white boys want to be me\nBut you don't want to go through What I go through\nTrue definition of a Blackboy\n\n[Verse 2 - Tech N9ne]\nIt must be the way that my pants sag\nOr the sparklin' diamonds on the watch my left hand has\nI know my appearance is lookin' like I am bad\nIn your department store all I wanna do is pop a damn tag\nMade it honest, that's why the blacks get mad at you\nEven foreigners shop and got big graditude\nI make more than you, but you got the attitude\nLike I can't be shoppin' at Saks Fifth Avenue\nI'm just tryin to buy my baby some creed spring flower\nBut they don't know that the Tecca Nina cheese means power\nSo they look at me like none of my breed brings valor\nThats why when you see us in passin' we seem sour\nLast time I checked, my power chakras\nI was on top of the indy charts and not a slotera\nBut I'm the author of darkness and I like the opera\nSo why when I'm at Macbeth they won't treat me more propera\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3 - Brother J]\nFrontline... shoot, soldiers represent that\nFrontline... shoot, Grand Verb, it's the snatch back\nHead wrapped in the desert, boombox on the camel back\nEscape from the clone lab, fugitives spook black\nWith finesse in you, its the knowledge from way back\nThe prophet of the page dont eat right till it all cracks\nBlackboy rappin from the pages torn\nStreet scriptures more classic than the Jimmy Cracked Corn\nA spawn of the movement, keep the music movement\nSo my purpose stays clear and my music stays groovin\nI do it for the real, I don't need Jena Six\nFor me to know America is still on that bullshit\nSo people think that black are just ball players and singers\nThat massa complex is what fuels the street bangers\nAnd street soldiers to stand up\nNo choice to get it right, so these Blackboys can finally get they man up\n\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 4 - Ice Cube]\nI'm a Blackboy and always gettin underestimated\nBut when I move next door, I know you hate it\nYou had my whole family investigated\nAnd when they didn't find no crack, you said I ate it\nUh-uh, a motherfucker just elevated\nOver ghetto life that was designated\nYou see this Blackboy, you know heaven made it\nI don't want to go if I got to integrate it\nYou know pellot boy, be happy you made it\nJust take what you got, and stop complainin'\nOk, weather man will stop the rainin'\nOn my people head, and start explainin'\nWhat your people said, believe in the Bible\nBut you still act barbaric and psycho\nMy name is Ice Cube, bitch, it ain't Michael\nI'll never bleach my own skin just to be like you\n\n[Refrain]


Happy Ending
[Tech N9ne]\nI didn't wanna fucking do this song, for real\nBut I wouldn't be real if I didn't\n\n[Tech]\nI be sittin by myself and thinkin, mamma what have I become\nAll I wanted was a family, but when I look I be the only one\nLosing everything but money, everybody left and I dont even get to see my young\nOnly happiness I get is in the studio or when I get to do another run\nOn the road, doin shows, get the woes, when it slows\nGettin cold, getting old, but the flows, gettin sold\nI've been doin this a minute but I think I wanna end it cause I'm on a higher level when I go\nBut the music I be doin it, be losin, make it hard for me to grow\nAll I wanted is a family portrait, see my babys on a ranch with horses\nBut I was fucking devil bitches in corsets. I was livin really good but I torched it\nI'm sorry ms jackson, I'm speakin for real and I never meant to make your daughter cry\nBut I guess I'm a failure with women and I'm lost and I feel like I ought to die\nFeel like I'm rotting away, my life is just off in the grey\nHow much does it cost I will pay, to lay, and be off in a coffin today\nI mean off in ashes, this life ain't after a classes, If I get blasted\nThis is Suicide Letters all over again, I thought that I passed it\nBut I guess that I didn't, cause this one is written and there is no mending\nWhen I'm broke I'm a joke, when I croke I just hope I won't be descending\nBut this ain't a joke, I want you to know that Tech ninna is never pretending\nAlone in my bed, a gun to my head, asking WHERE IS MY HAPPY ENDING? Ya\n\n[Hook]\nTell me how it ends?\n\nWhat about me? Where is my happy ending?\nWhat about me? Is this a life worth living?\nYou know how it begins, but how does it end for me?\nWill I ever win, or does he have it in for me?\nWill this stop before I stop breathing?\nIs their light in this dark I'm seein?\n\n[Tech]\nChea, I put my life in this music, nina is inside out\nI set my heart out for people, they know what the inside bout\nWill they keep feelin ninna forever, this I doubt\nCan never cry for help, if you listenin this my SHOUT\nI'm searching for the passage way to happiness\nBut I'm wordly So I have to lay in nastiness\nYes, this is Strange year, worldwide fames near, but the games queer\nSometime I feel like I'm rudolph, the reindeer\nBut instead of a red nose, I stay in my red clothes\nAnd the music they said blows, is on top and the cred grows\nCan you ressurect a mother fucker that feel like he pose as a dead soul\nDeteriorate to an inferior state almost equal to bread mold\nNow as my head goes, wish I could shed those\nBecause all the time the ninna was shorted, what I bled froze\nSo now that I'm cold blooded, and hella sick is what the med shows\nThe tread slows, and dont even think you reviving a dead rose. Chea\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Tech]\nI'm on the verge of insanity, but I'm competant\nI'm breakin so I pick this one to vent\nThe reason I look away when you talk to me my brain is producin evilness\nI'm drownin in 151 and rumble ments. Thats how I feel\nI sit in the mirror with this gun and practice how to kill\nBut I know damn well that the people like me really wanna know how to chill\nThis life is about a check, about a number about a bill\nThink about all the love I lost cause my quest is about a mill\nI feel like your stupid, dont talk to me I'm crackin up\nAnd I dont mean laughter I'm full of bitterness and its backing up\nAnd I live with angels, but lately demons been shackin up\nTug of war with my spirit, you see the blood I'm hacking up?\nI love my kids and my fans inside I sob harder\nCause you pay the price for my life and its right like Bob Barker\nAnd I won't pretend its ok I'm no facade starter\nSo I guess my only happy ending is in a massage parlor\nChea\n\n[Hook]
